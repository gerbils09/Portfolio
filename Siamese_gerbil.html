     <p>Siamese Gerbils are a easy pet to take care of. If you give them a lot of food before hand, you can leave them for two days alone. If you get an gerbil you should get two so your one gerbil won't be lonely. IF you don't have a lot of free time you can clean their cage ever two weeks instead of one week.</p>
